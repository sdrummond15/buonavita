PLG_SYSTEM_JDOWNLOADS_SET_MAX_LOGS_LABEL="How long, in days, should the rolling period for<br />keeping download logs be?"
PLG_SYSTEM_JDOWNLOADS_SET_MAX_LOGS_DESC="You can select an appropriate number of days for which the log data will be kept. It is strongly recommended that you set a limit for the period that log records are kept in the database. This avoids indefinite growth of the database table, which would eventually lead to problems. Older data will be deleted automatically once a day. If you have activated user restrictions, then the log data duration should be at least for the absolute maximum duration specified by any of the limits in all User Groups limits settings. You can find examples in the documentation. Recommended default value: 93 (days)"
PLG_SYSTEM_JDOWNLOADS_CACHE_RULES_INFO="Use the optional caching rules if you have activated the Joomla cache option. This turns off Joomla caching for the desired pages by using URL based parameters. Please read the documentation before you change the default setting given here."
PLG_SYSTEM_JDOWNLOADS_SET_CACHE_RULES_LABEL="Caching Rules"
PLG_SYSTEM_JDOWNLOADS_SET_CACHE_RULES_DESC="Add a line for each rule. Each line consists of a list of url parameters. For instance option=com_jdownloads&amp;view=search would turn off caching for com_jdownloads in 'search' view. You can also use ? for any value, for instance option=com_jdownloads&amp;view=download&amp;id=?."
PLG_SYSTEM_JDOWNLOADS_REENABLE_CACHE_LABEL="Re-Enable Caching<br />After Dispatch"
PLG_SYSTEM_JDOWNLOADS_REENABLE_CACHE_DESC="Whether caching should be re-enabled after a caching rule has fired. When this option is on the page will be cached partially, but components such as com_jdownloads won't be cached. This option doesn't work if the Joomla cache plugin is enabled."
