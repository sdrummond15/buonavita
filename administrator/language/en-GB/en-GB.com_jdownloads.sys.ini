Generally, it is recommended to create a full <u>backup</u> before this jDownloads upgrade. As part of the update process copies of all the jDownloads existing 3.2 tables are saved in the database with something like '-backup-3-2-69' appended to the table names.<br /><br /> 2. When you upgrade to version 3.9, some data fields in the jDownloads database tables are renamed. The supported external special extensions have upgrades available. Please see the documentation <a href="_QQ_"https://www.jdownloads.net/documentation-for-v3-9/getting-started-v3-9/upgrading-from-jdownloads-3-2-to-3-9"_QQ_" target="_QQ_"_blank"_QQ_" rel="_QQ_"noopener"_QQ_"/>Upgrading from jDownloads 3.2 to 3.9</a> for more details. However if you use other third-party extensions in jDownloads, it may be that they will no longer work and will need a corresponding update.<br /><br /> 3. The <u>'Custom Fields'</u> in jDownloads 3.2 are not longer supported by the new jDownloads 3.9 version. The new version now supports the new Joomla! Fields as these are more flexible and offer many more possibilities. During the upgrade process the former jDownloads 3.2 Custom fields and their stored values are converted to the new Joomla!
